> a gathering— a group study where participants each create a script according to a prompt. scripts are submitted by an established deadline. discussion and help will be provided to facilitate completion of scripts.

> this series will focus on softcut. for an introduction, see [softcut studies](https://monome.org/docs/norns/softcut/). for general norns scripting, see [norns studies](https://monome.org/docs/norns/studiy-1). this edition will also extensively use [clocks](https://monome.org/docs/norns/clocks).

# (norns/circle/02) rhythm and sound

![](https://github.com/monome-community/nc02-rs/raw/master/lib/nc02.jpg)

build a rhythmic, generative sound machine using provided tonal and percussive samples. provide your own textural/field/environmental audio clip to color your creation.

- 3 samples (two are provided (one tonal, one percussive), you provide a textural sample)
- 3 voices (keywords: clouded, sharp, clear)
- 3 clocks per voice which modify playback quality (keywords: location, elevation, presence)
- no USB controllers, no audio input, no engines
- map
  - E1 volume 
  - E2 velocity (overall tempo)
  - E3 regularity (simple rhythm vs. complex rhythm)
  - K2 shuffle
  - K3 draw
- visual accompaniment (keywords: data collection, rewritten history, cultural amnesia)

parameters are subject to interpretation. "elevation" could mean playback speed. "shuffle" could mean preserve rhythm and change parameter mappings. "draw" could mean progress to a new sequence, or randomize a quality, emerging something new.

notes:

- your included sound clip should be 10 seconds maximum
- feel free to use additional softcut voices for sonic embellishment, but keep it focused
- think both about short and long time: short syncopation, phrase-length modulation, microsound, breath

deadline: june 1

- submit your script by submitting a PR to github: https://github.com/monome-community/nc02-rs (we will help with instructions when the time comes, or feel free to submit early)
- record 2-6 minutes of the output of your script using TAPE. feel free to use the built-in reverb. upload to google drive, dropbox, etc. post link on thread.

to get started, go to maiden’s project manager, refresh the collection, and install `nc02-rs`. note, this will take some time to download as it includes some audio files.

if you need a hint getting started, check out ???.lua
